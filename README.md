ABOUT THE PROJECT

Welcome to my personal portfolio project, I've decided to rebuild my portfolio using Reactjs, because it's important, on my point of view, having a portfolio using a framework, trying to 
"simulate" the work environment where I must be used to menage projects using such technologies and many others.

Be free to send me any suggestions, I'm always willing to learn and get better. We never go far alone.

Thanks for you attention! :)
